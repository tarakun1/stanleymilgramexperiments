        <h2> Obedience Experiments</h2>
         
         <p class="parabox">Milgram’s obedience experiments were conceived in 1961 at Yale University. Prompted by the inconceivability of systemic killings in history—specifically during World War II—Milgram designed an experiment that would uncover the reasoning behind an individual’s obedience to authority. He assumed that his findings would decide whether the low and mid-level Nazi officers were just following orders, or were actually accomplices in the heinous crimes against the Jewish and minority populations during the war. </p>

<ul class="border parabox">The experiment was as follows: 
    <li> A random, public participant was paired with one of Milgram’s research constituents (unbeknownst to the public participant who thought that the pair were both random to the experiment);</li>
    <li> The random participant was assigned as “the teacher” while the research constituent was “the learner”; </li>
    <li> They were placed in different rooms with a one-way microphone—only “the teacher” could communicate with “the learner”;</li>
    <li> “The teacher” read a list of word association pairs and “the learner” had to memorize the correct pairing;</li>
    <li> If “the learner” offered the incorrect pair, they would receive an electric shock;</li>
        </ul>

<p class="parabox">It is also important to note that behind “the teacher”, another research constituent sat wearing a white, medical coat. This person was merely an actor but acted as the “authority figure” in the experiment. “The teacher” was instructed to continue the experiment until all the pairings were read, and they were instructed to raise the level of electric shock with every incorrect answer. Because “the learner” was a constituent of Milgram, there were no actual shocks administered during the entire experiment—“the teacher” only thought that “the learner” was being shocked. </p>

    
        
<p class="parabox">Findings: Almost every single “teacher” delivered the full set of electric shocks, even when “the learner” yelled in pain from the other room. Milgram deduced that “the teacher” shifted responsibility for the health of “the learner” unto the “authority figure” who was sitting behind “the teacher” urging him or her to continue the experiment.
