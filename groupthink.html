        <h2> Group Think</h2>
        
        <p class="parabox">Milgram's obedience experiments eventually led him to several groupthink experiments--groupthink being one's conformity 
        to group norms diminishing their individual agency. Many of these experiments were used in the media for comedic television in the 70s and 
        80s. The most famous experiment appeared on Candid Camera and is known as the "elevator sociology experiment"; cameras were placed inside 
        an elevator filming a random individual who is unaware of the experiment. The individual faces the doors of the elevator, like one usually 
        does, when several of Milgram's constituents enter the elevator and face the backside of it. In almost every instance the random individual
        in the experiment ends up turning toward the backside of the elevator as well to mimic the rest of the elevator-riders. </p>

<p class="parabox"> Another experiment was as simple as standing on a crowded sidewalk and staring up at the sky. Within minutes, Milgram found a 
crowd surrounding the sky-gazer, looking for the impetus of the focus.
