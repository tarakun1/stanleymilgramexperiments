        <h2>Lost Letter Experiments</h2>
        
        
        <p class="parabox">Milgram has cited this experiment as not one of his brightest. He aimed to study strangers' helpfulness toward various 
        groups toward which they were aligned or not aligned. He left hundreds of addressed and stamped envelopes across cities on the east coast 
        with different attn's: random names, stigmatized organizations like the Nazi or Communist Parties, or differing research institutes. He 
        found that most of the individuals who mailed the letters that they found had values that aligned with the organization or institute to 
        which the letter was addressed.  </p>
