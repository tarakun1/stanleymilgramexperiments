        <p class="parabox">Stanley Milgram (1933-1984) was a world-renowned American social psychologist.
            He earned his PhD from Harvard University and spent his career teaching at Harvard university, Yale University, and finally at the City University of New York Graduate Center. Despite the immediate controversial uproar regarding his obedience experiments and a decade of ethical criticism, Milgram is now one of the most important and cited psychologists in history. Milgram died at the age of 51 in New York City after his fifth heart attack. </p>
