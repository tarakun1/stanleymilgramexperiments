        <h2>Small World Theory</h2>
        
        <p class="parabox">The small world experiment is often recreated in psychology classrooms across the world, and is most notably known as the “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon”.  Milgram mailed out 160 pamphlets to random individuals in Omaha, Nebraska. In the pamphlet he wrote that he is trying to study the chain of relationships between strangers and if the individual could, to send the pamphlet to someone who might help it reach another random individual in Boston. Each individual wrote their name on a line in the pamphlet and sent it one degree closer to Boston. Milgram found that the average separation between two random people in the United States is only six people—hence, six degrees of separation, or “the small world”. </p>
